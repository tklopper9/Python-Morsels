I want you to make a class that represents a circle.

The circle should have a radius, a diameter, and an area. It should also have a nice string representation.

For example:

```
c = Circle(5)

c
Circle(5)

c.radius
5

c.diameter
10

c.area
78.53981633974483
```

Additionally the radius should default to 1 if no radius is specified when you create your circle:

```
c = Circle()

c.radius
1

c.diameter
2
```

There are three bonuses for this exercise.
