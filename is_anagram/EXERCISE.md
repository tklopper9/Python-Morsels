I want you to write a function that accepts two strings and returns True if the two strings are anagrams of each other.

Your function should work like this:

```
is_anagram("tea", "eat")
True

is_anagram("tea", "treat")
False

is_anagram("sinks", "skin")
False

is_anagram("Listen", "silent")
True
```

Make sure your function works with mixed case.

Before you try to solve any bonuses, I recommend you try to find at least two ways to solve this problem.

Okay now to the bonuses...
